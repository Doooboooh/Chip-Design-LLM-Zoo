# Chip Design LLM Zoo

[Chip Design LLM Zoo](https://iprc-dip.github.io/Chip-Design-LLM-Zoo/): A curated list summarizing current large models for Verilog generation, primarily aimed at evaluating large models used in Verilog code generation tasks.

## The Goal of this Repository

- To keep on track of state-of-the-art (SoTA) in Verilog generation tasks.
- To see a comparison of famous Verilog models at a glance (performance, size, etc.).
- To access their research papers.
